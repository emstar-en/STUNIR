Requirements resolution
Targets -> required contracts mapping:
contracts/target_requirements.json

Resolve requirements:
python3 tools/resolve_requirements.py --targets wasm,c --out receipts/requirements.json

Probe required deps (capability-based acceptance):
STUNIR_OUTPUT_TARGETS=wasm,c STUNIR_PROBE_DEPS=1 scripts/build.sh
# or run directly:
# STUNIR_OUTPUT_TARGETS=wasm,c scripts/ensure_deps.sh

Verify requirements satisfied:
scripts/verify_deps.sh

Receipt storage:
- Default: receipts are build artifacts and are not committed.
- Optional: snapshot receipts into fixtures for audit/review:
  scripts/snapshot_receipts.sh

Attestations:
python3 tools/inspect_attestation.py  --out receipts/attestations.json
