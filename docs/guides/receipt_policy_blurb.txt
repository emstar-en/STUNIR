Receipts are build artifacts: by default STUNIR generates and verifies them per run and does not commit them, but if you want a preserved copy for review/audit/regression we can snapshot the current receipt bundle (and build commitments) into fixtures and commit that snapshot (either as a “snapshot” for human diff/audit or as a “golden” CI baseline); this storage choice does not change STUNIR’s internal no-version conventions, and STUNIR outputs remain versioned exactly as the spec defines.
