Dependency contracts and probing

This repo assumes users provide toolchain dependencies.

Capability-based acceptance:
- A tool is accepted if it satisfies a contract and provides deterministic evidence on fixed test vectors.
- No hard pinned manifest is required.
- Optional attestation documents can be recorded alongside the tool.

Contracts: contracts/
Test vectors: test_vectors/

Example:
python3 tools/probe_dependency.py --contract contracts/c_compiler.json --out receipts/deps/c_compiler.json
python3 tools/probe_dependency.py --contract contracts/wasm_wat_to_wasm.json --out receipts/deps/wasm_wat_to_wasm.json

Receipt storage:
- Receipts are build artifacts by default (not committed).
- If you need a preserved copy for audit/diff/regression, snapshot to fixtures:
  scripts/snapshot_receipts.sh
