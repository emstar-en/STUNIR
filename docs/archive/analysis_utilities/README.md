## What Was Archived

### logical_reasoning/

Analysis utilities for logical reasoning and knowledge processing:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `anfis.py` | ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) implementation |
| `anfis_model.json` | ANFIS model configuration |
| `base_types.py` | Base type definitions |
| `deductive_engine.py` | Deductive reasoning engine |
| `knowledge_graph.py` | Knowledge graph utilities |
| `run_analysis.py` | Analysis pipeline runner |
| `__init__.py` | Package initialization |

---

## Why Archived

These utilities are analysis tools, not STUNIR pipeline components. They have been archived to:

1. Focus the repository on the SPARK pipeline as the primary implementation
2. Reduce clutter in the root directory
3. Preserve the code for future reference if needed
