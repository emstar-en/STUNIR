# Target language scaffolding

This directory collects **per-output-language planning artifacts** used to implement STUNIR output targets.

- Narrative implementation plans live under `docs/targets/<language>/`.
- Machine-readable target matrices live under `spec/targets/<language>/`.
- RFC6902 patch proposals live under `spec/patches/`.

These files are intended to be kept in-repo as part of the implementation record.
They are not build outputs.
