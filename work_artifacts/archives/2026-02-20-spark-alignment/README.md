## Contents

### generated_outputs/
Test output files generated by pipeline runs:
- `test_output/` directory
- `test_output.c`, `test_output.py`, `test_output.rs`
- `test_output_arm.asm`, `test_output_c.c`, `test_output_x86.asm`
- `hello.c`, `hello.txt` — Placeholder files from root `src/`
- `index.machine.json`, `manifest.machine.json` — Machine manifests from root `src/`

These are disposable generated files that can be regenerated by running the pipeline.

### backups/
- `docs_backup/` — Old backup of documentation

### execution_workspace/
- `stunir_execution_workspace/` — Runtime workspace used by pipeline execution

### build_artifacts/
Reserved for build artifacts that may be archived in future cleanup passes.

## What Was Removed (Not Archived)

- `obj/*` — Build artifacts (`.o`, `.ali`, `.stderr`)
- `__pycache__/` — Python bytecode cache
- `src/` — Removed after archiving contents
- `bin/` — Empty directory removed
- `inputs/` — Empty directory removed
- `test_integration/` — Contents moved to `tests/`

These are regenerable and do not need archival.
