  Prevent losing track of progress when generating multiple tools sequentially.
  The TODO should include:

  1. List of all tools (from the guide)

  2. Status for each tool (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)

  3. Clear section headers for each phase

  4. Ability to mark tools as completed without losing context

Maintain a TODO list to track which powertools have been generated and which still need generation.
