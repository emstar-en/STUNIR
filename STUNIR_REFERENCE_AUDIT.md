## Recommended actions
1. Regenerate the index bundle after any repo relayout that moves docs or changes navigation structure.
2. Keep `AI_START_HERE.md` as a stable alias pointing to `ENTRYPOINT.md` (or vice versa), but ensure the index bundle matches the current reality.
3. Keep placeholder READMEs pointing back to `ENTRYPOINT.md` to prevent crawl loops.
